# OASIS Questions

**All text attributed to individuals is paraphrased.**

Jim Cabral: OASIS regularly sends things to ISO, so Internationalization can come in there. Ask about it tomorrow.

Jim Cabral: This might be an Open Project, which allows for a lot of self-governance. The requirements are at the high level, but lower is up to you. More flexible than the Technical Committees.

Questions:

- Internationalization?
- Changes to charter
- Changes to organization
- Is this an Open Project or Tech Committee?
- NIT(?) has an accreditation process. Does OASIS have the same?

## Dialogue with OASIS

Katherine Escobar: NMO proposes OASIS, new model, more open source pattern. NMO becomes Project Governing Board (PGB). NTAC and NBAC become Steering Committees. (NTASC?)

Jim Cabral: Contributor License agreement. For a TC, you have to be an OASIS member, but not for Open Projects.

_Contributor License Agreement CLA needed for steering committee members._

Mike Hulme: Who are the sponsors funding this?

Katherine Escobar: Happens at the PGB, fees based on the number. DoD would pay, like $25k to be on the board. But additional funding for dedicated developer resources. Making it more a 100% funded project. Up to now, it's been run by gov't, and funded entirely by whoever was the PMO at the time.

Chet Ensign: Open Projects are supported by sponsors, rather than member fees. Sponsorship is per project.

Dr. Scott: Is there a means to handle bad actors?

Chet Ensign: No real means for this.

_What does the sponsorship fund? The OASIS support? Who pays the developers?_

_$2,000 annual fee for orgs of 10 or fewer members._

Mike Douklias: Can we keep our stuff on Github?

Chet Ensign: Yes, but with some branding. Minimal. Identify it as an OASIS thing. Logo, footers with copyright. They have templates for specifications, including Markdown.

_This may impact specification generation._

## Internationalization

Jim Cabral: How do we do this? Everything is in English, tags, definitions, documentation.

Chet Ensign: ISO submissions are in English.

Vamsi Kondannagari: Who approves the new content?

Chet Ensign: We do, just like we do now.

_Who cracks the whip? Who is Katherine Escobar in this scenario? Does the PGB appoint one?_
